# FBSD
Slightly modified version of https://github.com//nicholasbernstein/install-fbsd-desktop
plus some extra scripts to configure doas and my printer.

Run the script as the root use as follows you can use:

fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeboMoskva/fbsd/main/setup.sh -o - | sh

...or not; Like Nicholas said « You're a grownup. Make your own decisions about how you want to do things. »
